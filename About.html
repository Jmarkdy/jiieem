              <p id="qwe">Hi! My name is John Mark, I live near our neighbor's house (lmao). All jokes set aside, I live in Lubrin Heights, City of San Fernando, La Union. I made this website because League of Legends was one of the best games I've ever played. I've been playing this game since grade 6 until my 9th grade. I remembered my bestfriend playing this game with me, since we met, we played together, and we taught each other. He was supposed to be my very bestfriend, but unfortunately, he went to another friend and left me. I know it's very sad knowing that my bestfriend left me and went to his other friends, but I know this is how life works, and I know that God has a plan for me. I want to give him my deepest and greatest gratitude, for being my bestfriend for 4 years straight, who taught me not only in League of Legends, but in the real world.</p>

              <p id="qwe"> I also want to give my greatest acknowledgement to my partner, who has always been here at my side even in hard times. She the one who's supporting me in whatever I do. She the one, who's always making me laugh and giving me geniune happiness. She may give me problems, and make me cry but I know to myself that she doesn't deserve someone who gives up quickly. Even though sometimes she's making me cry, she gives me geniune happiness a million times! She taught me how to be responsible not only in school and in house, but in EVERYTHING! I really thank God for giving me such a wonderful blessings that I don't deserve having it. Without her, I can't do all this HTML and CSS, she taught me how to listen carefully, and inspired me to do my tasks at my best. I love her. I really do.</p>
